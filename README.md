# FW/1 & LogBox Example
An example of using LogBox as a Subsystem in an FW/1 application.

### How to use:

- Make sure you have [Commandbox installed](https://commandbox.ortusbooks.com/content/setup/installation.html).
- Clone the repo or drop the zipped contents into a directory.
- Fire up Commandbox by entering `box` in your terminal and `cd` into the project root directory.
- Run `install && start`.
- Start hacking away!

_Currently set up to support Lucee which will start by default on CommandBox. For Adobe ColdFusion to function, Administrator level mappings will need to be set, and the syntax for extending FW/1 changed._
